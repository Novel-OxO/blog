## Why MDX?

MDX combines the simplicity of Markdown with the power of JSX. It lets you write content that feels natural while embedding interactive components when needed.

Here's what makes MDX great for developer blogs:

- **Familiar syntax** — Write in Markdown, add JSX when you need it
- **Component reuse** — Import and use React components directly
- **Type safety** — Full TypeScript support in your content pipeline
- **Rich plugins** — Leverage the unified ecosystem (remark, rehype)

## Getting Started

Setting up an MDX pipeline involves a few key pieces. First, you need a way to parse frontmatter:

```typescript
import matter from 'gray-matter'
import fs from 'fs'

const file = fs.readFileSync('content/posts/hello-world.mdx', 'utf-8')
const { data, content } = matter(file)
```

Then, configure your MDX compiler with the plugins you need:

```typescript
const options = {
  mdxOptions: {
    remarkPlugins: [remarkGfm],
    rehypePlugins: [rehypeSlug, rehypeAutolinkHeadings],
  },
}
```

## Content Elements

### Text Formatting

You can use **bold text**, _italic text_, ~~strikethrough~~, and `inline code` just like regular Markdown. Links work too — check out [Next.js documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs) for more.

### Ordered Lists

1. Define your content schema
2. Create the parsing utilities
3. Build the rendering pipeline
4. Style your components
5. Ship it

### Code Blocks

Here's a more complete example of a content utility:

```typescript
export async function getPostBySlug(slug: string): Promise<Post> {
  const filePath = path.join(POSTS_DIR, `${slug}.mdx`)
  const raw = fs.readFileSync(filePath, 'utf-8')
  const { data, content } = matter(raw)

  return {
    slug,
    content,
    readTime: readingTime(content).text,
    ...(data as PostFrontmatter),
  }
}
```

### Tables

GFM tables are supported out of the box:

| Feature        | Markdown      | MDX           |
| -------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| Headings       | Yes           | Yes           |
| Code blocks    | Yes           | Yes           |
| JSX components | No            | Yes           |
| Frontmatter    | Plugin needed | Plugin needed |
| Type safety    | No            | Yes           |

## What's Next

This is just the beginning. Future enhancements include:

1. **Syntax highlighting** with Shiki for beautiful code blocks
2. **Category filtering** to help readers find relevant content
3. **Table of contents** auto-generated from headings
4. **SEO optimization** with proper meta tags

Stay tuned for more updates as we build out the full blog experience.
